# OctoAcme Project Management Documentation

Welcome to the OctoAcme Project Management Documentation hub! This collection of documents serves as the single source of truth for how we plan, execute, and continuously improve our project delivery processes.

## Overview of OctoAcme Project Management

At OctoAcme, every project begins with a clear initiation phase where we establish the business need, identify key stakeholders, and define success criteria. This ensures that all team members and stakeholders are aligned on objectives before significant work begins. During planning, we break down initiatives into actionable increments with a prioritized backlog, clear milestones, well-defined "definition of done" criteria, and proactive risk management strategies. Our planning approach emphasizes iterative delivery, allowing teams to ship value incrementally while maintaining flexibility to adapt to changing needs.

Execution at OctoAcme follows a structured approach using project boards to visualize work, daily standups to maintain momentum and surface blockers, comprehensive code review and pull request conventions to ensure quality, and transparent reporting mechanisms to keep all stakeholders informed. We employ defined escalation paths for blockers and maintain accountability through clear ownership assignments.

Our roles are well-defined to ensure smooth collaboration: Project Managers coordinate delivery, schedules, and communications; Product Managers define outcomes and prioritize the backlog; Developers implement features collaboratively; QA ensures quality standards are met; and Stakeholders provide essential input and approvals at key decision points. Communication is central to our success, with regular touchpoints including daily standups for the delivery team, weekly syncs between project and product leadership, milestone-based stakeholder updates, and clear incident reporting and escalation procedures. All project information is documented and accessible, serving as a single source of truth that reduces confusion and keeps everyone aligned.

Quality assurance is embedded throughout our process with both automated and manual QA practices, CI/CD checks that run on every change, and proactive risk and incident management. We are committed to continuous improvement: after each milestone or significant incident, we conduct blameless retrospectives to capture learnings, track actionable improvement items, and review progress on previous commitments—ensuring that we consistently evolve our practices based on real experience.

## Purpose and Scope

These process documents serve multiple critical functions:

- **Onboarding**: Help new team members quickly understand how OctoAcme manages projects, what artifacts to expect, and how roles interact
- **Reference**: Provide templates, checklists, and guidance for common project management activities
- **Continuous Improvement**: Document our current best practices while remaining open to evolution based on team learnings
- **Team Alignment**: Ensure consistent practices across projects and establish shared language and expectations

These processes apply to all cross-functional projects delivering product features, services, or integrations at OctoAcme.
